					Talia Trilling is a software engineering fellow at Hackbright Academy, set to graduate in 
					December 2016. She graduated with honors from Pitzer College, majoring in Psychology and 
					minoring in Media Studies. Previously, Talia was employed as a psychology research and teaching assistant, where she conducted extensive literature reviews with two professors and eventually implemented an online survey via Qualtrics and Amazon MTurk that was completed by over 1000 participants. Although she was experienced with SPSS and other data analysis tools commonly used in the social sciences, she found herself wanting to learn other more complex ways to interface with this data set. This interest inspired her to learn how to code in Python, and she has since discovered her love of software engineering more broadly as an avenue for continued learning and a way to present information to people in a more meaningful manner.<br>
					Outside of software engineering, Talia is interested in neurobehavioral research, video games design, and LGBTQA activism as well as intersectional and alternative uses of media.
