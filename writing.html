								<li>One of four students selected to complete a senior honors thesis in Psychology </li>

							Abstract: <blockquote cite="citation.html">Cyberbullying is a growing phenomenon affecting individuals of all ages who use the Internet.
Although extensive previous research has been conducted on the psychology of children who cyberbully, and to a lesser extent, on the experience of being cyberbullied, the role of bystanders in response to what is often a very public event has not been explored in an experimental, non- self-report context. Additionally, the role of bystanders and what motivates them to react to bullying events has only minimally been explored in online contexts. College-aged participants were recruited to complete what they were told was a computer-based discussion task focused on campus life, but what was actually a simulation with three fake participants that devolves into an event of cyberbullying. It was hypothesized that females would be more likely to intervene than males and that male participants would be more likely to intervene when presented with a female target then when presented with a male target. No significant results were found for either of the hypotheses, and study limitations as well as future directions are addressed in the discussion.<sup><a href="#citation1">1</a></sup>
